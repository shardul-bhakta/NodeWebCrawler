# NodeWebCrawler

This is a simple web crawler, which takes an URL as a command line argument and saves the contents of the URL for further processing.

## Steps

### Node and npm Installation
Go to https://nodejs.org/en/download and download a one-click installer for your OS by clicking on the Install button.

The installers come with npm (Node package manager)â€” an important tool for managing dependencies. Because npm comes with Node, there's no need to install npm separately.

### Get this clone
Download this clone to your local machine. `git clone https://github.com/shardul-bhakta/NodeWebCrawler.git`

### Install packages
Go to the top directory of this clone on your machine and run -
`npm install`

This will automatically locate the `packages.json` file and install all packages in it.

### Execution

Run the command - `npm src/crawler.js https://nodejs.org/api/`.

Sample result is stored in the folder - `/src/f6a7db1c-6f0d-430e-a37a-8006c9a46fca/`
